# 📊 Twitter Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Twitter engagement data to gain insights into **user behavior, tweet popularity, and engagement trends**. By using data visualization techniques, we explore how likes, retweets, and timestamps influence social media interactions.

## 📂 Dataset Details
- **Source:** A dataset containing 10,000 tweets.
- **Columns Included:** 
  - `Tweet_ID`: Unique identifier for each tweet.

  - `Text`: The content of the tweet.
  - `Retweets`: Number of times the tweet was shared.
  - `Likes`: Number of likes received.
  - `Timestamp`: Date and time of the tweet.

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Converted `Timestamp` to a readable datetime format.
   - Removed duplicates and checked for missing values.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - **Visualized** the distribution of likes and retweets.
   - **Plotted** likes vs retweets correlation.
   - **Analyzed** engagement trends over time.

3. **Sentiment Analysis (Optional):**
   - Used **TextBlob** to classify tweets into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiments.
   - Compared engagement levels based on sentiment categories.

## 🔍 Key Insights
